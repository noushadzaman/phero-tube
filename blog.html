    <h2>What do you mean by REST API?</h2>
    <p>REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface.REST APIs use HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources, which are typically represented as URLs, and they follow a stateless client-server communication model. </p>
    <h2>Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h2>
    <p>var:
        Function-scoped.
        Hoisted to the top of their containing function or global scope.
        Can be redeclared within the same scope.
        Not block-scoped.<br>
        let:
        
        Block-scoped.
        Not hoisted to the top of the block, which prevents "temporal dead zone" errors.
        Cannot be redeclared within the same scope.
        Can be reassigned.<br>
        const:
        
        Block-scoped.
        Not hoisted to the top of the block.
        Cannot be redeclared or reassigned within the same scope.
        Should be used for variables that should not change their value after initialization.</p>
        <h2>Tell us the use cases of null and undefined ?</h2>
        <h3>null:</h3>

          <p>  Used to explicitly represent the absence of any object value.
            Often set intentionally by developers to indicate that a variable or object property has no meaningful value or reference.</p>
            <h3>undefined:</h3>
            
            Represents the absence of a defined value, typically for uninitialized variables or object properties.
            Automatically assigned to variables that have been declared but not assigned a value.
            Used by JavaScript as the default return value of a function that doesn't explicitly return anything.</p>
